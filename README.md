# Lynx - The HL2 XBOX XZP Editor
This is salvaged code that was made by Prodigy.

## What does this do?
- You can edit XZP files, pack files from the Half-Life 2 XBOX Port.
 - You can replace files within the package. But you cannot add files at this moment.
- You can edit BSP Files, editing entities within the file without having to re-compile.
